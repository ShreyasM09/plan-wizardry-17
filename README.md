## Project info

## So what? Anything else interesting besides the name?

Yep, you get the intermediary tasks that are distributed over time, along with deadline for each of them and dependencies on previous tasks, if any. This gives a gradual progression for your project giving you time, ample to learn and apply and just enough to not lose interest (yes your procrastinating habit has been taken care of). Also, all of this is displayed through a pretty cool design.
